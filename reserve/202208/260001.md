## 笔试实录

1、手撕代码：字符串（C++环境）

给定一个字符串，求满足此条件的最长连续子串的长度：子串中每个字符出现次数都是偶数次。（和leetcode上<a href="https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-the-longest-substring-containing-vowels-in-even-counts">每个元音包含偶数次的最长子字符串</a>很相似）

2、手撕代码：数组（C++环境）

给定一个数组，求一个满足此条件的最长子数组的长度（不必连续）：子数组中任意两个数的差都是给定的$M$的倍数。

3、手撕代码：数组（C++环境）

有两个等长的数组`A`和`B`，由这两个数组生成数组`C`，`C[i]`为`A[i]`或`B[i]`，求按照此规则生成数组`C`之后，没有出现在数组`C`中的正整数的最小值。
